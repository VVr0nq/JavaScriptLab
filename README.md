# **JavaScriptLab**

## **Overview**

This repository contains various labs designed to help learn and practice JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Each lab focuses on different aspects of web development, offering practical tasks and projects.

## **Labs**

### **Lab1**
This web page features a simple interactive interface that allows users to input numbers into two fields. When the "Count" button is clicked, the script calculates and displays the sum, average, minimum, and maximum of the entered numbers, showing the results dynamically on the page.

### **Lab2**
This web page features an interactive image slider implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The slider displays a series of images that users can navigate through using left and right arrow buttons. It also includes a play/pause button that controls the automatic transition of images. The JavaScript code handles the navigation logic and the play/pause functionality, allowing for dynamic interaction with the image slides.

### **Lab3**
This code implements a drum kit simulator web page. Users can play different drum sounds by pressing corresponding keys or buttons. The page allows recording and playback of sounds in four separate channels. A metronome feature is included, with adjustable beats per minute, to help keep rhythm. Users can also play back all recorded channels simultaneously or select specific channels for playback. The interface includes controls to start and stop recording and playback, providing an interactive musical experience.

### **Lab4**
This code creates a simple note-taking web application. Users can add, edit, and delete notes with titles, content, and customizable colors. Notes are stored in the browser's local storage, allowing them to persist across page reloads. The app also supports pinning notes for easy access. It provides buttons to add or edit notes, clear all notes, and toggle a form for entering note details. The app dynamically displays pinned and unpinned notes, with options to manage each note's properties interactively.

### **Lab6**
This code creates an interactive animation where balls bounce within a canvas on a web page. Users can start or reset the animation with buttons. Clicking on a ball removes it, and two new balls are added. The balls repel from the mouse cursor when it gets too close, and lines connect nearby balls. The animation runs at 60 frames per second, displaying the current number of balls. This visualization demonstrates basic physics and interactivity in a 2D space using the HTML5 Canvas API and JavaScript.

### **Lab7**
This web page is a weather application that lets users add and view the current weather conditions for up to 10 cities using the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can enter a city name, which then displays the city's temperature, humidity, and weather conditions. The application uses local storage to save the list of cities and display them upon reloading the page. Each city's weather information includes a delete button to remove it from the list, allowing for dynamic updating and management of tracked locations.
